# Introduction

This blog post provides a high-level summary of our paper ["Benchmark of cellular deconvolution methods using a multi-assay dataset from postmortem human prefrontal cortex"](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03552-3) published in *Genome Biology* in April, 2025 [@huuki-myers].

In this deconvolution benchmark project we set out to determine the most accurate method for predicting cell type composition in bulk RNA-seq data from brain tissue. We also evaluated method for selecting marker genes, and introduced the *MeanRatio* method for marker gene selection. The dataset developed for this experiment, *MeanRatio* functions, and other helpful tools for deconvolution are available in the [*DeconvBuddies*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/DeconvoBuddies.html) Bioconductor package.

## What is deconvolution?

Complex tissue is made up of different cell types that express genes at different levels. In bulk RNA-seq this heterogeneity of the tissue is obscured, and the gene expression measurements represent a mixture of all of the cells and cell types in the sample. Differences in the cell type composition between samples, either technical or biologically real, can confound downstream analysis such as differential expression.

Deconvolution is an analysis that infers the cell type composition of bulk RNA-seq data, using gene expression profiles from single cell data.

## How to preform deconvolution?

To run deconvolution you'll need:\

1.  Your Bulk RNA-seq gene expression data

2.  A refrence single cell RNA-seq gene expression data set, from the same tissue type

3.  A deconvolution method (computational algorithm)

## Available Deconvolution Methods

Reviewing the literature we found 20+ deconvolution methods available. This presents quite an overwhelming choice for researchers! Are there big diffrences between methods? If so how can we chose the most accurate method?

## Existing Benchmarks

Benchmark studies aim to test and rank the performance of available methods. There have been several benchmarks studies on deconovlution methods, both with-in papers presenting new methods and as separate studies. However there is not much of a consensus on which method is the most accurate:

**Benchmarking results from different papers on “real” data**

-   **MuSiC paper** [@wang2019]**:** MuSiC \> NNLS \> BSEQ-sx \> CIBERSORT

-   **Bisque paper** [@jew2020]**:** Bisque \> MuSiC \> CIBERSORT 

-   **Cobos benchmark** [@avilacobos2020]**:** DWLS \> MuSiC \> Bisque \> deconvoSeq

-   **Jin et al. benchmark** [@jin2021]**:** CIBERSORT, MuSiC \> EPIC\*, TIMER, DeconRNAseq

-   **Dai et al., benchmark** [@dai]: Dtangle \> Bisque \> Other Methods

Additionally the Cobos et al., 2020 benchmark study shows that different methods preform best on different data sets [@avilacobos2020].

A challenge in benchmark studies is producing a "ground truth" estimate for cell type composition. Often in benchmarks pseudobulk mixtures created from the single cell data are used as the bulk data, so the absolute composition is known.

However we think pseudobulk data might not be a stand-in for real bulk RNA-seq data. Better to use orthogonal measurement of cell type compositions paired with real bulk RNA-seq data. We also were curious about the performance of methods specifically in brain RNA-seq data.

This motivated us to run our own deconvolution benchmark study!

# Deconvolution Benchmark Study

![Benchmark study design: Use orthogonal RNAScope cell type proportions to evaluate accuracy of deconvolution methods](images/Deconvolution_compare_proportions.png)

## Study Design

We designed an experiment to evaluate the performance of deconvolution methods on human brain tissue, specifically the dorsal lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC). We used consecutive slices of 22 DLPFC brain blocks from 10 neurotypical donors, to create three assays:

1.  RNAScope: orthogonal measurement of cell type compositions for six major cell types (n=25)

2.  snRNA-seq: reference single nucleus data (n=19)

3.  Bulk RNA-seq: using a variety of library types and RNA extractions methods (n=110)

![Diagram of study design. A. Cartoon of brain region and brain block with consecutive slices. B. Tile plot showing available samples and quality control status](images/sfigu_study_design.png)\

### RNAScope Cell Type Proportions 🔬

To obtain orthogonal measurements of cell type proportions for six major cell types in the DLPFC, we utilized multiplex single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) combined with immunofluorescence (IF) using RNAScope/IF.

We designed two probe combinations:

1.  **Star** measures:

    1.  Excitatory Neurons (Excit)

    2.  Mircoglia (Micro)

    3.  combined Oligodenrocytes and Oligodendrocyte Precursor cells (OligoOPC)

2.  Circle measures:

    1.  Inhibitory Neurons (Inhib)

    2.  Endothelial/Mural cells (EndoMural)

    3.  Astrocytes (Astro)

We used HALO to segment and label cell types, then calculated cell type porotions for each sample.

### Single Nucleus Reference dataset

The snRNA-seq data was previously analyzed as part of the spatialDLPFC project (see [Huuki-Myers et al.](10.1126/science.adh1938), or [previous blog post](https://lahuuki.github.io/posts/2024-05-23-spatialDLPFC/#single-nucleus-rna-seq-1) for more details. This reference consist of 56k nuclei from 19 samples with seven broad cell types.

### Bulk RNA-seq Data

For the bulk RNA-seq we we curious if using different library types (polyA or RiboZero) and RNA Extraction (nuclear, cytoplasmic, or total) would impact the accuracy of deconvolution. So for each brain block we prepared one sample of each library combination.

Analyzing just the bulk RNA-seq data we saw large differences in gene expression between the different preparations of the bulk data, principal component analysis shows the data divide by library type and RNA extraction.

### Which methods to test?

From the large number of available methods we selected six methods that were previously selected as top performers in other benchmark papers, and applied a range of different approaches.

## Marker Gene Selection

A strategy to improve accuracy in deconvolution is to limit the analysis to a set of cell types marker genes, reducing noise in the analysis. To help select cell type specific marker genes we have developed the *Mean Ratio* method.

The *Mean Ratio* method works by selecting genes with large differences between gene expression in the target cell type and the closest non-target cell type. We calculate the `MeanRatio` for a target cell type for each gene by **dividing the mean expression of the target cell by the mean expression of the next highest non-target cell type**. Genes with the highest `MeanRatio` values are selected as marker genes.

![Illustration of *Mean Ratio* marker selection method, and heatmap of top *Mean Ratio* marker genes](images/get_mean_ratio.png)

For more information about selecting marker genes with *Mean Ratio* see [Finding Marker Genes with DeconvoBuddies](https://research.libd.org/DeconvoBuddies/articles/Marker_Finding.html).

In our benchmark we found that methods responded differently and unpredictably to different marker gene sets, but top methods preformed better using the top 25 *Mean Ratio* marker genes for each cell type.

## Method Performance 🏆

On to the main event: time to **evaluate the deconvolution methods!**

We preformed deconvolution on the 110 bulk RNA seq samples, with each of the six selected methods, using the top25 Mean Ratio genes.

We then compared the estimated cell type proportions with the RNAScope cell type proportions. We calculated **Pearson's correlation and the root mean squared error (RMSE)** between the two. Methods with high correlation and low RMSE are the most accurate.

**Overall *Bisque* and *hspe* were the top preforming methods.** 🏆

These were also the top methods in Dai et al., benchmark which also examined brain data [@dai].

Bisque preformed slightly better in polyA data, *hspe* slightly better in RiboZero data. *CIBERSORTx* was a close third place, preforming similarly to Bisque and *hspe* in polyA data.

## Other Results

Above I have highlighted the main study design and conclusions of our deconvolution benchmark. In the paper we explored many more facets of deconvolution method performance. Some other results to highlight:

-   *hspe* is sensitive to marker gene selection

-   *Bisque* can preform poorly with \< 4 donors

-   *Bisque* an *hspe* are unaffected by including "case" donors in the snRNA-seq reference

-   *Bisque* is biased to cell type proportions in the reference snRNA-seq data set

-   *Bisque* and *hspe*

# DeconvoBuddies

![](images/deconvobuddies_logo.png)

In conjunction with this study we have developed a Bioconductor package [DeconvoBuddies](https://research.libd.org/DeconvoBuddies).

DeconvoBuddies is currently on the [devel branch](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/DeconvoBuddies.html) and will be included in the next release (April 2025) release of Bioconductor.

The main features of the package are:\

**Find Marker Genes**

-   Implements Mean Ratio marker gene selection `get_mean_ratio()`

-   Implements 1 vs. All marker gene selection `findMarkers_1vALL()`

**Plotting tools**

-   Quickly plot gene expression over cell types (or other category) `plot_gene_express()`

-   Plot top marker genes with annotated statistics `plot_marker_express`

-   Plot Composition bar plots of deconvolution outputs `plot_comoposition_bar()`

**Access Data**

-   Access paired data from consecutive slices of human DLPFC, used in deconvolution benchmark `fetch_deconvo_data()`

    -   Access the RNA-scope, snRNA-seq, and bulk RNA-seq data described above

# Truly TL;DR

In this benchmark we used a multi-assay dataset from the human DLPFC to compare deconvolution performace in six top methods. RNAScope/IF cell type estimates were utilized as an orthogonal measurement of the true cell type composition. We developed the *Mean Ratio* method to select highly specific cell type marker genes.

**The top preforming deconvolution methods in brain were *hspe*[@hunt2019] and *Bisque* [@jew2020].** 🏆

We found many factors such as n reference donors, marker genes selection, and library type of bulk RNA-seq can impact performance of deconvolution methods. The dataset, MeanRatio function, and other useful functions for deconvolution are included in our Bioconductor package [DeconvoBuddies](https://research.libd.org/DeconvoBuddies).
