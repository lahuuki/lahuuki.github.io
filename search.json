    "text": "RNA-sequencing¬†\nOne of the ways that we can understand the functions of different cell types and structures in the brain is to study what genes they express by sequencing the RNA in a tissue. Recently, several advanced transcriptomic1 approaches using RNA sequencing have emerged, enhancing our ability to analyze gene expression in the brain.\n\nThis LEGO brain schematic demonstrates the evolution from bulk RNA sequencing, which provides a mixture of cell types, to single cell/single nucleus RNA-seq, which reveals the transcriptional profiles of individual cell types. The latest advancement, spatial transcriptomics, links gene expression to specific anatomical locations, providing deeper insights into the relationships between brain structure and function.\n\nSingle Nucleus RNA-seq\nSingle nucleus or single cell RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) enables us to examine the gene expression of individual cells or nuclei. This technique relies on uniquely barcoded gel beads that attach to a single cell or nucleus, tagging all RNA molecules from that cell. When sequenced, these tagged RNA molecules can be traced back to their original cell. Cells or nuclei are then typically clustered by their gene expression profiles to identify different cell type populations. The expression profiles and cluster assignments are often visualized using reduced dimension plots such as UMAPs or tSNE. In these plots, each point represents a cell, and the distance between points indicates their similarity2; closer points represent more similar cells, which are often of the same cell type (shown by different colors).\n\n\n\nCartoon of 10x snRNA-seq process (via 10x Genomics), and tSNE plot\n\n\nIn this experiment we are working with nuclei, as the cell membrane is destroyed when the brain tissue is frozen. The major cell type populations to identify in the DLPFC are neurons (Excitatory and Inhibitory), glial cells (ex: Astrocytes, Microglia, Oligodendrocytes, OPC), and vascular cells (Endothelial & Mural).\n\n\nSpatially Resolved Transcriptomics (Visium)\nSpatially resolved transcriptomics maps RNA to specific locations on a tissue sample, allowing us to profile gene expression across anatomical features such as blood vessels, glands, or, in our case, layers of the brain‚Äôs cortex.\n\n\n\nCartoon of Visium spatial transcriptomics (via 10x genomics), and example spot plots\n\n\nWe used Visium slides, which feature a grid of approximately 5,000 spots arranged in a 6.5x6.5 mm area. Each spot has a unique barcode that binds to the RNA in the contacted tissue. When the RNA is sequenced, these molecules can be traced back to their specific grid locations, similar to the barcodes in snRNA-seq.¬†\nThis RNA-seq data is paired with a high-definition histology image of the original tissue, providing additional information and aiding in data visualization. We can visualize the gene expression of each spot in ‚Äúspot plots‚Äù using color gradients overlaid on these images. In the example above we highlight the location of the gray matter with SNAP25 a gene highly expressed in neurons, MBP highlights white matter, and PCP4 marks layer 5.\n\n\nStudy Design¬†\n\n\n\nStudy design for spatialDLPFC\n\n\nIn this study we analyzed the DLPFC of ten healthy adult donors. We sampled three locations of the DLPFC: the anterior, middle, and posterior. All 30 samples were analyzed with Visium spatial transcriptomics, 19 (about 2 from each donor) were selected for snRNA-seq."

    "text": "Spatial Registration of BayesSpace Clusters\nTo check which resolution of BayesSpace clusters best matches the six histological layers plus white matter, we used a useful analysis we‚Äôve developed called ‚Äúspatial registration‚Äù. We will delve into the details of this analysis in a future blog post, and its application in this vignette.\nBriefly this analysis compares the gene expression profile of a reference set of clusters such as spatial regions or domains, annotated features, or cell type populations etc. (in this case the manual annotations from the pilot dataset), to a query set of clusters we want to learn more about (the BayesSpace clusters). The t-statistics from an enrichment analysis in the query and the reference set are correlated, pairwise across all groups. We visualize this in a heatmap where the high correlation is green, low correlation is purple.¬† Where a query cluster has high correlation with a reference cluster, we can say the two groups are associated, and if the correlation passes our threshold we annotate the query group with the reference.¬†\nIn the below example \\(Sp_{7}D_{7}\\) has a high correlation with the manual annotation white matter, we then annotate it as¬†\\(Sp_{7}D_{7}\\sim WM\\). This annotation helps add biological context to our newly defined spatial domains.\n\n\n\nExample spatial registration between manual layers and k=7 BayesSpace clusters\n\n\nFrom this process we learned that k=9 best reiterated the expected pattern of six layers + white matter, by matching each spatial domain to only one layer. In contrast to the k=7 resolution where some of the spatial domains (\\(Sp_{7}D_{2}\\) and \\(Sp_{7}D_{3}\\)) matched more than one layer. K=9 split white matter and Layer 1 into two spatial domains with unique gene expression.\n\n\n\nBayesSpace k=9 cluster spatial registration vs.¬†manual layers\n\n\nFor higher resolution clustering, k=16 was determined to be the optimal number of clusters based on the fast H+ statistic, so based on the data this is the best way to cluster the data. This further split the six original layers into 2-3 sub-layers each. The maximum number of clusters we could comfortably run on our computing setup was k=28, at this high number of clusters we lose the laminar definition."

We performed a cell-cell communication analysis which predicts which cell types are interacting with each other, and then identified overlapping LR pairs with risk of schizophrenia from databases with the cell-cell communication results. From the common set of LR pairs we examined ligand EFNA5 & receptor EPHA5. From the snRNA-seq populations, EFNA5 was most expressed in Excit_L5/6, and EPHA5 in Excit_L6. From the Visium data we identified spots where the two genes were co-expressed, most frequent in \\(Sp_{9}D_{7}\\sim L6\\), these spots also had high proportions of Excit_L5/6 neurons and Excit_L6 neurons predicted by spot deconvolution. Spatially mapping LR pairs helps us gain insight into the potentials for drug development. (This cool work was completed by Boyi Guo and Melissa Grant-Peters)\nThis analysis used many elements of the data from the spatialDLPFC project, and is just one example of how this dataset is relevant to the study of disease. In another application we also checked for enrichment of depression and PTSD related genes between the spatial domains. There are lots of exciting applications for the study of diseases with spatial and single cell, stay tuned to future work from the Lieber Institute for more! üëÄ"
